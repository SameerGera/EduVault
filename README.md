  <h1>🏛️ EduVault</h1>
  <p><strong>Unforgeable Digital Credentials for Atmanirbhar Bharat</strong></p>
  <p><i>Eliminating academic fraud through Decentralized Trust</i></p>
</div>

## 🚀 Vision
EduVault is an indigenous trust infrastructure designed to secure India's academic future. By transforming degrees into **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)**, we eliminate the 30-day manual verification backlog and render certificate forgery mathematically impossible.


## Prototype
Just go to:
http://edu-vault-jet.vercel.app/

## ✨ Key Features
* **Soulbound Credentials:** Non-transferable tokens (SBTs) that are permanently "bound" to a student's digital identity.
* **Instant Verification:** Employers can verify authenticity in seconds via a simple QR/Hash scan.
* **Privacy-First (DPDP Compliant):** Only cryptographic hashes are stored on-chain; sensitive personal data remains off-chain.
* **Cost-Efficient:** Built on **Polygon Amoy (L2)** to keep issuance costs under ₹1 per student.
* **Social Recovery:** Uses **ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)** concepts to allow institutional recovery of lost wallets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Polygon Amoy Testnet, Hardhat
* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons
* **Interaction:** Ethers.js
* **Dev Environment:** Vite, TypeScript
